# Maps

In the Maps application, we can add our favorite places to our list by pinning them from the map and create navigation to these pinned locations. In order to reach our location on the map, we first import MapKit and CoreLocation into our application, press and hold the selected point for 3 seconds and create a pin, and we use GestureRecognizer for this. We use the CLGeocoder interface for conversion between geographic coordinates and place names.
